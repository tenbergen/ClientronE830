        SBPLAY version 2.59 March 21, 2000 by John A. Ball

        SBPlay is a utility for playing back sound files. It works with
        Sound Blaster compatiable cards and other types of sound cards with
        the use of DIGPAK drivers. It will also use the regular PC speaker.
        It does not require a sound board. To use the program type

        SBPLAY filename or SBPLAY

        where filename is the path to the file if required and filename can
        include wild card characters. Filename extensions are not required.

        SBPlay works with any Sound Blaster compatiable sound card or your
        pc speaker. Other sound cards are supported using a DIGPAK driver.
        To use SBPlay with a DIGPAK driver you must install the DIGPAK
        driver before using sbplay. I.e. type
        SNDSYS    to install the driver and then use
        SBPLAY    to play your sound files on a Windows Sound System board.

        After you are done the resident sound driver can be removed by
        SNDSYS U

        SBPlay can be made to use the PC speaker instead of your Sound
        Blaster card by changing the environmental string for BLASTER.
        I.e. set BLASTER=NOSB will disable your sound card and divert the
        sound to the PC speaker.

        Version 2.59 will play back Tandy Sound files (SND), Creative Labs
        (VOC), Microsoft (WAV), Apple (AIF) and Amiga (IFF) & (RAW) files.
        There is also some support for MAC files and .AU files.
        SBPlay will also play the samples in (MOD) files at the last used
        frequency. Try using the /X command line option to see the song
        patterns. It will try to play back unknown files or raw data files
        such as MAC SND files at 11,000 samples per second. The sound files
        should be uncompressed, 8 bits, and unsigned. Note other types of
        files can be played by using the command line options to change the
        defaults. I.e. R:22000 to change the playback speed to 22,000 samples
        per second.

        SBPlay will also rip sound samples from MOD files and will create
        the SAM sample files which were used to create the original mod file.
        SAM files are used by MOD editors to create MOD files and usually
        contain musical instrument sounds or other sound effects. WAV and
        VOC sound files can also be created.

        SBPlay can be used to play a randomly selected sound file from a
        directory with the /RAN switch. This can be used to play a different
        sound file each time the computer boots by placing the following
        command in the autoexec.bat file:

           SBPLAY c:\sound\*.* /s/ran

        where c:\sound is a directory containing sound files. The /s prevents
        any file information from being shown on the screen and the /ran
        selects any one of the files that are available.

        SBPlay is compatiable with DESQview, Windows 3.1/95, and OS/2.
        It can be used to play back sound files by associating the sound file
        extension with SBPlay in windows and DOSShell.

        Note: When using SBPlay in DESQview your system may lock up! For
        best results use a full text screen and don't enable the background.

        If a mouse and mouse driver is present then SBPlay will use it to
        select and play files. Try clicking the left mouse button on the
        file to be played or the command.

        The main program is written in C and the sound routines for the PC
        speaker and Sound Blaster card are written in assembler. I used
        QuickC 2.51 with Assembler to create this program. The source
        code is available see register.me for details.

        There are limitations to this program.

        1) SBPLAY does not play back ALL sound files which have been
           compressed.
        2) There are audio gaps during the playback of large sound files
           on slow PCs and when using a multitasker. SBPlay will use EMS
           memory to load all or as much of the sound file as possible into
           expanded memory for playback.
        3) The volume control works only with Sound Blaster Pro and 16 cards.
        4) If you have a CD Rom drive with no cd in it when you change drives
           with the F3 command the infamous dos abort, ignore, retry error
           occurs. Choose the ignore option or put in a cd.
        5) SBPlay supports 8bit mono and stereo playback on Pro and 16 cards.
           It does not use 16bit playback mode.

        Problems:

        I have found an error in some motherboards that causes SBPlay to
        play back at twice normal speed when using the PC speaker. This is
        an error in the chip design of the motherboard. To correct the
        problem place a FIX=T2 statement as the last line of your sbplay.ini
        file or use the command switch /T2. Also previous versions of SBPlay
        would crash some AST computers when no sound board is present. I
        think I have fixed this problem.

        SBPlay uses the DOS environment to help find the hardware
        configuration. It looks for the BLASTER variable to determine what
        the hardware address is, the IRQ, the DMA channel, and the board type.

        i.e.

        SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T3

        will tell SBPlay that the Address is 220h, the IRQ is 5, the DMA
        channel is 1, and the card type is 3 (SB ver 2.0). If your board
        is configured for another DMA channel such as 0, the D parameter
        must be D0 . If you have a Sound Blaster compatiable card and SBPlay
        locks up try using T-1 to tell SBPlay that your card is not a Sound
        Blaster card. If the hardware address or IRQ is not correct in the
        BLASTER variable SBPlay should give you an error message and you can
        use the /x parameter on the command line to find the correct hardware
        information.

        Starting with version 2.56 you can save your defaults with the
        save defaults command in the defaults menu F1. The defaults are
        saved in SBPLAY.INI in whatever directory you are in unless you
        have the SBPLAY environmental statement in your autoexec.bat.
        For example

        SET SBPLAY=C:\BLASTER

        in your autoexec.bat file will cause SBPlay to save it's SBPLAY.INI
        file in the C:\BLASTER directory.

        The playback speed for the PC speaker can be set with the D command
        by calling up the defaults with F1. The speed can be saved by
        writing to the SBPLAY.INI file. 

        SBPlay can be made to use the PC speaker even when a Sound Blaster
        card is available by using the T1 switch in the command line or by
        placing a FIX=T1 statement in the sbplay.ini file.

        Also new is the registeration command @ . This command is used for
        saving your name as the registered user and the registration number
        obtained from the author John A. Ball. There is a password required
        in order to use this command which can be otained via e-mail by
        registering! Please read the file register.me .

        When using a CD-ROM if you go to change drives and there is no cd
        in the drive you will get the abort, retry,, ignor error. Place a
        cd in the drive and go r (retry) or use i (ignore). If you wish
        to convert a sound file such as an aif to wav that is on a cd, type
        the drive and directory you want the converted file saved to when
        asked the name of the file.

        When using the file shell there are commands to delete, rename, and
        copy files. The delete command is d. The rename command is r. And
        the copy command is c. 

        Also sbplay may be used to play a sound file continuously upto
        32,000 times using the command line mode L:xxxxx , where xxxxx is
        the number of times to play the sound file. Good for a noise or
        special effects file.

        The use of this program is free but you must register your use of
        this program. By registering I receive the feedback required to
