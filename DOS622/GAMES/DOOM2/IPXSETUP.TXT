**********************
** What has changed **
**********************

* "-name <pname>" specifies a player name. Only used in "-altctf" in
  ctfdoom no other modes make use of it.

* Environment variable DOOMENV, can now be set specifying an alternate
  EXE file.                                                 (1st-feb-98)

  eg. (At command prompt)
      SET DOOMENV=ctfdoom.exe

  Will try to launch ctfdoom.exe before any other doom .EXE

* Changed the "." to a spinner.

* New parameter "-player <playerno>". Where playerno is between 1 and 4.


****************
** How to use **
****************

Allows players now to select which team they wish to play for.

    Teams
      1        Players 1(Green)  & 3(Brown)
      2        Players 2(Indigo) & 4(Red)

    This is extremely useful if you have a 4 player game setup with 2
computers in each room. Usually IPXSETUP will decide players numbers by
their network node address this parameter forces a player number into the
game.

NOTE : If "-player" is not used the original code is used.

eg.
   Lets assume we have a 4 player game set up without the "-player" parameter
   with two machines in each room.

   Room 1
   Player 1  (IPXSETUP Chooses the Player Numbers)
   Player 2

   Room 2
   Player 3
   Player 4

   Now seeing as the CTF implementation uses players 1 & 3 on one team and
   2 & 4 on the other, this really is NOT an ideal setup!


   To overcome this now is extremely easy :

   Room 1
   Player 1  IPXSETUP -player 1 -ctf -file <mapname.WAD> -nodes 4
   Player 3  IPXSETUP -player 3 -ctf -file <mapname.WAD> -nodes 4

   Room 2
   Player 2  IPXSETUP -player 2 -ctf -file <mapname.WAD> -nodes 4
   Player 4  IPXSETUP -player 4 -ctf -file <mapname.WAD> -nodes 4


   Thats it!! Players are now set up the correct way!


********************
** Considerations **
********************

Try to make the fastest machine (see below) "-player 1", it really doesn't
matter if you don't except the game performance might not be as good.

THE FASTEST MACHINE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE FASTEST (!what a contradiction!)
assume Player "y" has a Cyrix P166+ only running at 320x200 and Player "z" is
using a Pentium 200 running at 640x480. The pentium in my opinion should
DEFINATELY NOT be Player 1 it's having to manipulate more than 2x the amount
of graphics the Cyrix has to.

Too see this run the CTFDoom EXE with "-timedemo demo1" on all machines
to check the gametics vs realtics and the framerate. This should give you
an indication whether the machine has the power to be player 1.

(Or drop you resolution back a bit!)


***************
** Compiling **
***************

To re-compile the source you need Borland C 3.1, create a project file called
IPXSETUP and include all the .C files in the project.

Set optimizations to OPTIMIZE FOR SPEED and use the small memory model.
