              Initial Installation and Operation Instructions
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This README.TXT file is intended to help get you started with
    SpinRite, but it does not try to be completely exhaustive or
    comprehensive.  For complete information on owning and operating
    SpinRite, please download the complete SpinRite 5.0 Owner's Guide
    from our Internet web site at http://grc.com. (Additional
    supplementary documentation is also available on-line for your
    convenience.)

    All downloadable documentation uses Adobe Corporation's excellent
    multi-platform "Acrobat" format so you can instantly download,
    view, and enjoy high quality documentation which can be readily
    printed if you wish.

    To view or print any of this information, you must have version
    3.0 of the FREE Adobe Acrobat reader installed on your system.
    Free readers are available for MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows
    95/98 and NT.  To get the reader, visit Adobe's web site at
    http://www.adobe.com then click on the little Orange "Get Acrobat
    Reader" icon to chose the free version that's best for you.

    SpinRite has been designed to be easy to use without ANY manual.
    Other products make this claim, but since SpinRite's task is very
    well defined there's really nothing for you to do other than point
    it at your drive(s) and turn it loose.  If you read each screen
    carefully you'll find all the help you need right when you need
    it.

    The ONLY thing that's at all tricky about using SpinRite might be
    getting it to "see" all of your important drives.  But again,
    there's a very simple rule of thumb:  "If you can see the drive
    from the DOS prompt, SpinRite will see it too."  In other words,
    if you can give the directory listing "dir" command on a drive
    (for example "dir f:") without DOS giving you an error message
    like "Invalid drive specification", "General failure reading
    drive" or "Write protect error reading drive", then SpinRite
    will "see" the drive and be able to run on it without trouble.

    But if Windows is providing the device drivers for your drives,
    then you might find that DOS won't be able to "see" them when
    you're at the DOS prompt.  Even though SpinRite 5.0 is a cool
    Windows/DOS hybrid program which runs directly from within
    Windows, it still has a heart of DOS and actually runs from the
    DOS prompt.

    Because there are SO MANY different types of controllers and
    drives, we can't know about every possible combination. Therefore,
    if DOS cannot see your drive there's no way that we would know
    what you should do. (We'd love to if we could.)  You will need to
    examine the documentation that came with your system, drives, or
    controller to determine how to make them visible from DOS.
