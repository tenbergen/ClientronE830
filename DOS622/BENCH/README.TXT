Hello DOS Retro Gamers!

I'm Phil and you might have seen me online under PhilsComputerLab.

More people are getting excited about DOS Retro gaming, mostly
building Retro Gaming PCs, Time Machines, Sleeper PCs, whatever you
want to call it.

Often documentation is sparse or difficult to find, so I put together
various starter packs to make life easier and make this hobby
more accessible.

So this is a DOS Benchmark Pack. It includes various 3D benchmarks,
CPU benchmarks, diagnostic tools and utilities. All of these tools
are easily found online, I just put them all together with a simple menu.

A lot of people want to check their retro machines and how it compares.
Is it running properly or is something not right? This DOS Benchmark Pack
gives you test results that you can then compare with others.

I have previously made a similar Pack, but with less benchmarks. The
results from the previous pack are identical to this one,
so results can be compared between them.

Enjoy!

Phil
